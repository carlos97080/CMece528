kl_project.py tested in python 2.7.10 and it should work with most versions
of python but is not guaranteed. It will not work with python 2.4.3, which is 
installed in the MCECS Linux servers. In this case run kl_project_for_mcecs.py.
to find out which verison of python is intalled in the system type "python -V"

in order to run from command line in Linux or in Mac terminal type.

python kl_project.py  inputfile [-f]

Or for mcecs

python kl_project_for_mces.py inputfile [-f]

the â€“f option is optional it should only be used for large files with large node count.

Example:
python kl_project.py KLinput20F2015.txt

this will run the class example

python kl_project.py input_2851nodes.txt -f
this will run the file with 2851 node (of course you need to name it this in your system) with the fast option
