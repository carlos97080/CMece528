kl_project.py tested in python 2.7.10 and it should work with most versions
of python but is not guaranteed. It will not work with python 2.4.3, which is 
installed in the MCECS Linux servers. In this case run kl_project_for_mcecs.py.

in order to run from command line in Linux or in Mac terminal type.

python kl_project.py  inputfile [-f]

Or for mcecs

python kl_project_for_mces.py inputfile [-f]

the â€“f option is optional it should only be used for large files with large node count.
